## Overview
This project builds an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to transform two datasets into second normal forms, and store them into a database.

A database diagram (DBD) is created to help navigate the database. 

## Files:
* /crowdfunding_db_schema.sql: The final database compiled.
* /crowdfunding_dbd.png: The DBD for visual relationships and organiztion of the database. 
* /ETL_Mini_Project.ipynb: The source code for the project, implements the ETL pipeline.
* /Data/: This directory stores the input and output data files.
    * /Data/Input/: Contains the input data files that will be processed by the ETL pipeline.
    * /Data/Output/: The output data files generated by the ETL pipeline are stored in this subdirectory.
